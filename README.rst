Template for the Read the Docs tutorial
=======================================
this is a fork from mkdocs to add some features to it in order to be suitable for RTL languages.

Forking Goals
-----
as mkdocs is a powerful, quick tool to build up documentation I am trying to make it compatible with Right to Left languages (Pesian, Arabic, Kurdish as far as I am concerned); the problem is not just texts to align them in right side but also tabs and menus should be so. 
be uploaded soon.
